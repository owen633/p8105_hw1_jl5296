# Problem 1

The **code chunk** below creates a *data frame* consisting of:

1. A random sample of size 10 from a uniform [0, 5] distribution

2. A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

3. A length-10 character vector

4. A length-10 factor vector

```{r problem_1}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(1)
unif <- runif(10, 0, 5)
unif[1:10]
mean(unif)

vec_logical <- c(unif)
vec_logical > 2
mean(vec_logical > 2)

vec_char <- vector("character", length = 10)
length(vec_char)
mean(vec_char)

vec_fac <- factor(c("male", "male", "male", "female", "male", "female", "male", "female", "male", "female"))
length(vec_fac)
mean(vec_fac)

```

The mean of the random sample is `r mean(unif)`

The mean of the logical vector is `r mean(vec_logical > 2)`

The mean of the character vector is `r mean(vec_char)`

The mean of the factor vector is `r mean(vec_fac)`

Only the first two variables could be taken means because they have numeric values assigned whereas the last two conprise only letters and characters.
